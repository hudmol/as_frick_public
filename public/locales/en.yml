                         <p>The Archives' mission is to document, preserve, and make available historical

                         papers of the Frick family, and archival collections in the areas of art
                         history, scholarship, and collecting.  This site allows users to search and
                         browse our finding aids, which are descriptive inventories of archival collections.</p>
